# v3

The third version of Xee API

## Why ?

The `v2` of our API was good in terms of content, but there were some *ugly* things.

- Dates were not the same everywhere
- Errors were not the same everywhere
- Sometimes it was v1, sometimes v2

So we decided to build a `v3` to get a new begining. The goal is to be *simple*, *easy*.

- Dates are `RFC3339`
- Errors look the same everytime

## Authentication

> The authentication is a *special* case.

We can't provide a REST API for *authentication* for a simple reason: *User passwords would be known from every single app*

So the authentication is handled by us, in a web page for now (that might change one day for mobiles).

The process is quite simple, don't be afraid!

> Have a look at [auth readme](auth/README.md) for the auth documentation and the **errors it can throw**

|API|Description|
|---|---|
|[`/auth/auth`](auth/auth.md)|For the authentication page|
|[`/auth/access_token`](auth/access_token.md)|For the *access token* API|
